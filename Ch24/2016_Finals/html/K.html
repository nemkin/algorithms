<h2>K. Tiles</h2>
<table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">

We've reached the next level in tile switching challenges. A team of trained programmers and chemical experts arrived at a storage facility to prevent a serious accident. Inside the facility there are different kinds of explosive materials stored in cubic boxes. These chemical have strange properties: each side of each box has a number(between 0 to 3) representing different reaction types.
If two boxes are next to each other, and the neighbouring sides have the same properties (represented by the same number), then a chain reaction might go off and the world would end.
We would like to prevent such things, so programmers must come up with an algorithm and idea to save everybody. During the process they have to switch cubes to achieve a space where no neighbouring side has the same colour.
Note that time is running up, so you have to minimize the number of steps!!
The objective is that no 3D cube should have sides that have similar colour as the next cube' side touching the examined side. This applies for all 6 sides of every cube.

<h3>Input</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td valign=top><h3>Example input</h3>
<pre>
Example input
2 3 3
2 1 3
0 0 2
1 3 3
3 2 1
0 1 3
2 0 1
</pre>
Explanation:
first row means the upper bound (maximum coordinates in each direction): X = 2, Y = 3, Z = 3
we have two layers (x=2) each with size 3x3
others rows represent elements (for example):
there's a cube at coordinates (1, 1, 1), its value is 2: meaning that this 1x1x1 unit has chemical type 2
there's a cube at coordinates (1, 1, 2), it's value is 1
there's a cube at coordinates (1, 2, 1), it's value is 0
there's a cube at coordinates (2, 1, 1), it's value is 3
etc.

<td valign=top><h3>Example output</h3>
<pre>
Example output(two x,y,z values, you change the first cube with the second):
1 3 3 1 2 1
</pre>
Explanation:
The cube located at (1, 3, 3) will be switched with the one at  (1, 2, 1) therefore every neighbouring side has different chemicals at the end.
