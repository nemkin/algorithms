<ul>
<li>Web submission: A static output file must be uploaded through the submission site.
<li>Interactive: During the solution or the submission, either network
communication or other kind of interaction is necessary.
<li>Score decreases with time: Submitting at the end of the contest is worth 70% of what would be awarded at the beginning.
<li>Penalty for wrong answer: Wrong answer gets -5 points (different value may be specified explicitly in the task description).
<li>Time delay after fail/pass: Duration in minutes while no new submission is accepted after a wrong/correct answer.
<li>Scaling: The score for this problem may change over time depending on submissions by other teams. (Note that your last submission is considered and not your best one.)
