<p>
You are given a string S of '(' and ')' characters of length n. You are to find the number of its longest regular bracket subsequences. Answer should be output modulo 104857601. </p>
</table>
<p>
A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+'.</p>

<p>
For example, the longest regular bracket subsequence of the string S="())())(" has length 4. There are four such subsequences: [0,1,3,4], [0,2,3,4], [0,1,3,5], [0,2,3,5]. So, the answer for this case is 4.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

The first line of input contains one integer (1 &le; T &le; 10<sup>6</sup>) - the number of testcases. 

Each of the next T lines contains a string consisting of bracket characters. The total length of all strings doesn't exceed 2*10<sup>7</sup>.

<h3>Output</h3>

Output T lines with answers for testcases, one integer per line.
