A tromino is a polyomino of order 3, that is, a polygon in the plane made of three unit-sized squares connected edge-to-edge.
When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are only two different free trominoes: 
"I" and "L" (the "L" shape is also called "V"). When rotations are also considered distinct, there are six fixed trominoes: 
two I and four L shapes. 

Let f(N,M) be the number of ways you can fill a rectangle with size N,M with trominoes. For example f(3,3)=10.

PWD: f(3,14)*f(3,15).
