There are N prisoners standing in a circle and waiting to be executed. 
The counting out begins at some point (let us call it place 1) in the circle and 
proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction (place 2,3,4,...). 
In each step, one prisoner is skipped and the next one is executed. 
The elimination proceeds around the circle 
(which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), 
until only the last person remains, who is given freedom. 

N=10^21

Which place should you choose in the initial circle to survive?
